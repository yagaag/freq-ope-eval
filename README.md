## Evaluation of Freq-OPE

Freq-OPE is a novel order-preserving encryption scheme based on [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1so_jRS9AGCLSB59gEl16hqq7uEn4hW4p/view?usp=sharing).

It is available as a python package which you can find [here](https://pypi.org/project/freq-ope/) and its source code [here](https://github.com/yagaag/freq-ope).

This is an evaluation of the scheme in comparison to other existing Order-Preserving Encryption methods from other works. We have also added a demonstration of the usage of the library.
